# Subresource Integrity Calculator
This tool will help generate the code needed to use subresource integrity for your offline files.

To use this tool, drag and drop your CSS and JavaScript files in the box with the dashed outline. The page will then generate the code for each of the files in a section below the box. The code will have the label “SRI” on the left and the code itself will be on the right, starting with the word “integrity”. Copy this code to your HTML where those files are referenced.

*This is what the output looks like. The portion outlined in red is what you copy to your HTML.*
